Hello everyone, and welcome to the inaugural Revolt round-up! This post marks the first of what we intend to be a monthly series on the Revolt blog, aiming to compile everything that's been happening both on and around the platform without the need to comb through Github commits and developer messages.

We won't just be highlighting what the Revolt team has been up to, but also shining a spotlight on the community.

## Android App

Jennifer has continued to dedicate her time and talent to the native Android app, and it's coming along beautifully. As one of the few that's had the privilege of using it, I can say it's a pleasure. Swipes are smooth and it looks a treat.

###### Preview of current app design

We're happy to announce the next phase of beta testing will commence soon, at which point you'll be able to see the app's source code as well as try exciting new features.

> "Making an app for a feature-rich platform like Revolt can take quite a while, especially if your goal is to write code that is both sturdy and can be expanded upon years into the future. It's actually quite an iterative process to get everything to feel 'just right', considering both the obvious parts, such as how the user may behave, as well as smaller details, like users on larger screens or optimal thumb placement on phones. For example, I can show you some screenshots made during the development of the upcoming attachment preview. I hoped to get it to feel just right in the end, and I think I may have done it!"

## Voice/video calling

We've started preliminary work on replacing our old voice server with a completely new, battle-tested real-time media server. It's based on the same technology that powers the [Zed](https://zed.dev/) code editor among other things. This means that video calls, screen sharing, proper calls and voice channels are all monumentally closer, albeit we still need some time to cook. We'll share more as soon as we have more to say, but for now enjoy this exclusive peek at a tech demo we were experimenting with for the new real-time media server:

## New developers website

Our developers website has gotten a refresh and has been designed to be as easy as possible for anyone to contribute to its improvement. You can check it out now at [developers.revolt.chat](https://developers.revolt.chat).

## Tidbits

Here are some things that don't really deserve their own section but are worth mentioning:

-   The new web frontend is currently on track, development has picked up pace as of the start of June, so look out for the coming monthly updates!
-   We are working to embolden our commitment to Free and Open Source Software, more formal information will be published at a later date. Feel free to drop in and ask how we're improving.

# From The Community

As this is our first installment, we haven't received many contributions from the community to showcase just yet. However, we're eagerly awaiting submissions of all sorts. Whether it's your own creation or a fascinating project you've stumbled upon, we'd love to feature it in a future roundup.

To get in contact, you can post a message in the #Month in Revolt channel within the [Revolt server](https://rvlt.gg/Testers) or [reach us another way](https://support.revolt.chat/contact).
